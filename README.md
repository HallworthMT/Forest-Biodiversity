# Forest biodiversity responses to changing climate across the Americas: Synthesis of long-term ecological data

## David Luther, Lynn Christenson, Nina Lany, et al. 

Biodiversity and ecological communities are changing rapidly due to climate change, however it has been difficult to disentangle changes attributable to climate from changes due to habitat destruction. In addition, the vast majority of studies on the subject do not incorporate long-term data. Long-term research from specific locations, such as LTER sites, has led to the accumulation of large quantities of local data of individuals, species, or specific taxonomic groups. We propose to bring together ecologists, data managers, and statisticians in a workshop format to harmonize data from long-term research sites in forest ecosystems, such as Long-term Ecological Research (LTER), International Long-term Ecological Research (ILTER), ForestGEO, United States Forest Service (USFS) experimental forests, National Ecological Observation Network (NEON), and National Park Service (NPS) biodiversity monitoring sites to bridge the scales of different sampling methods and taxonomic groups and assess the long-term effects of climate change on forest communities across the Americas. Results from the workshop will lead to innovations in harmonizing data across sampling methods, spatial and temporal scales, and a strong research network of ecologists that study a broad range of taxonomic groups focused on understanding the long-term changes in forest ecosystems both at local and macrosystem scales.
