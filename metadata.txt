# Metadata for the Climate Velocity and Forest Fragmentation 

residenceTimes_climate_variables.csv
 - File that contains the time (in years) that the current climate is projected to remain similar in the 5km bounding box around
   the long-term study sites. Each row corresponds with a study site where I used the siteID. The columns represent the different variables (tmin, tmax, ppt, dsi[drought suseptibility index]) 
   for the two months (Jan, Jun). For completeness, I've included both the magnitude of change (voccMag) and the direction of change (voccAng).
   The residence time for the direction of change is meaningless here. However, the magnitude of change and the projected residence time (in years)
   can be a helpful metric to compare across sites/regions. 
   
Gradient_Climate_Velocities.tif - geotiff file
 - Stacked raster (i.e., many layers) that have the magnitude of change (km/yr, voccMag) and direction of change (deg, voccAng) for 
   each of the climate variables (tmin, tmax, ppt, dsi) in the two months (Jan, Jun). Climate data were obtained from TeraClim (# Monthly climate data 
  # https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/IDAHO_EPSCOR_TERRACLIMATE #). Data from 1990-2024 were used to calculate
  climate velocity. Climate data were accessed in Google Earth Engine via R. Climate velocity was calculated using the VOCC R package.
